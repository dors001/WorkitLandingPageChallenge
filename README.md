## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project tought me great basics for CSS and HTML, especially in how to manage my development work and understanding the styling tools at my disposal.

Using components make the development process much easier, as a novice front-end dev it change my perspective completly and made developing a much more of a high quality, enjoyable process.

I made sure to use only the basics of HTML and CSS with incorporating only a couple of sections that use grid and flexbox, i took the project in the goal in mind of creating a strong foundation of the basics of the HTML and CSS languges.

This project was extreamly enjoyable and educating!
This project is a fantastic way to start your journey into Fron-End development.

### Continued development

From this point i will solidify my basics in JavaScript while continue to sharpen my HTML and CSS skills so in the future i could go into React with more confidence.
